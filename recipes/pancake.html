    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
    </ol>
